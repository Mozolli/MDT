Mobile Device Tester

I made this app for my own purposes to help doing some light mobile device demoing to my WWW or mobile app projects. 
There are no external JS libraries, images or icon fonts and whole solution is around 20Kb.

iFrame loader doesn't work too well over web since most sites are blocking it. Best way to use Mobile Device Tester is to load a copy and drive it with local content.

Switching default mobile device to iPhone X at some point. Maybe even adding some device listing of the popular models.
Hope you find this helpful!
